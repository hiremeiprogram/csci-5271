    <h2>Hands-on Assignment 1 virtual machine instructions</h2>

    <p>Hands-on assignment 1 is about exploiting bugs in a poorly written program
    in order to take control of a Linux system. In order to make this
    realistic but still not have you interfering with each other or
    taking over CSE Labs machines, you'll test out your attacks using
    a virtual machine that we've set up. These VMs will be spread
    across a cluster of network-accessible machines run by CSE
    Labs. This page gives directions and some hints about how to use
    your VM effectively.
    </p>

    <h3>Getting started instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>To start, send an email to the TA (Nishad Trivedi, triv0025 AT umn.edu) requesting a VM, giving the names and
      UMN IDs (@umn.edu email addresses) of your group members,
      remember no more than 3.</li>

      <li>You'll get a reply from Nishad, assigning your group some
      unique identifiers. Specifically your group will have three
      numbers: in the discussion and sample commands below, we'll
      write these numbers as GG, HH, and PP, so whenever you see those
      you're supposed to fill in your group's numbers. GG is a unique
      number for your group, ranging from 1 to the number of groups we
      have (probably no more than 50). HH is number of the computer
      your VM will run on (H for "host"); as of this writing we've
      been assigned computers 33 through 36. Finally PP is a number,
      probably between 11 and 19, telling which network ports your
      machine's VM will use on the machine. Neither HH nor PP is
      unique to your group, but the combination of the two will be.
      </li>

      <li>SSH into the machine csel-esx-xHH.cselabs.umn.edu where HH is
      the host number mentioned before. (These machines used to just
      be named xHH, and they are still accessible that way from some
      places, but their more official names now have the csel-esx-
      prefix.) Then run the command:

	<p><tt>/export/scratch/csci5271/ha1/master/setup-vm</tt></p>
	
	<p>This will create what we'll call your group directory,</pp>

	<p><tt>/export/scratch/csci5271/ha1/groupGG</tt></p>

	<p>and put in it a fresh virtual machine disk image file named
	<tt>ha1.qcow2</tt>. The disk image is about a 3GB file, so
	copying it will take at least 10 seconds.</p>
      </li>

      <li>For convenience, change directory into your group
      directory. The remaining special commands will be set up as
      symlinks in this directory so you can run them with "./".
      </li>
      
      <li>Start your VM for the first time using the command
      <tt>./run-vm</tt>. This command will take over your terminal,
      and print some reminders, but you won't see any messages
      directly from the boot process. It may take a minute
      or two, but soon after you see the <tt>login:</tt>
      prompt printed in the terminal, you'll be ready to go on to the
      next step.</li>

      <li>The recommended way to log into your VM is with SSH from a
      different window. The ports used by your VM are probably blocked
      by the department firewall, so you can't SSH in directly from
      anywhere, but you should be able to SSH in from any CS or CSE
      Labs machine on the Keller Hall wired network. The most natural place
      to SSH from is your assigned xHH machine. You
      should use the command:

	<p><tt>ssh -p PP22 student@xHH.cselabs.umn.edu</tt></p>

	<p>Where PP and HH are replaced with the port and host numbers
	mentioned above.</p>

	<p>The VM comes with an account named <tt>student</tt> which
	is set up for your use. Initially the password for the account
	is <tt>loans</tt>, but you'll need to change the password the
	first time you log in. Share the password with the other
	members of your group, but not with anyone outside your
	group. Specifically on the first time you'll have to type the
	old password <tt>loans</tt> twice, then your new password
	twice, then log in again with the new password.</p></li>

      <li>The <tt>student</tt> account has the ability to run commands
      as <tt>root</tt> using the <tt>sudo</tt> command, so you're
      generally free to administer the computer as you see fit. For
      instance if you'd like you can create separate accounts for each
      group member.
      There's a pre-created account <tt>test</tt> that
      you can use as a clean, unprivileged account for testing
      exploits. To start it's not set up with a login password, but
      you can change the password with the command <tt>sudo passwd
      test</tt>.</li>

      <li>BCZIP is installed in <tt>/usr/bin/bczip</tt>, and the setuid wrapper program is in <tt>/usr/bin/bcunzip-as-root</tt>. 
      There's also a copy of the source code
      and Makefile in <tt>/src</tt>. But note that
      the copy of the binary in /src is not setuid.
      </li>

      <li>For experimenting with changes to the binary BCZIP files,
      it's convenient to use a tool known as a ``hex editor'': a
      variant of a text editor that is specialized for binary files
      instead of text, for instance showing byte values in
      hexadecimal. The <tt>hd</tt> command will print the contents of
      a file in hex. We've installed a number of terminal-mode hex
      editors you can try running within the VM: for instance
      <tt>hexer</tt> has a vi-like interface; <tt>tweak</tt> has an
      Emacs-like interface (and there's also hexl-mode in Emacs
      itself), and <tt>shed</tt> has a beginner-oriented
      interface. There's also <tt>beav</tt>, <tt>dhex</tt>,
      <tt>hexcurse</tt>, <tt>hexedit</tt>, <tt>hte</tt> <tt>le
      -h</tt>, and <tt>hexeditor</tt>.
      </li>

      <li>The VM simulates a 64-bit processor and is running a 64-bit
      kernel, but BCZIP is compiled as a 32-bit program to better
      match our class discussions and older tutorials. If you want to
      compile your own code in 32-bit mode, you need to pass the
      <tt>-m32</tt> option to GCC, or the <tt>-32</tt> option to
      <tt>as</tt>.
      </li>

      <li>When you're done using the VM for a while you should turn it
      off. The recommended way of doing this is by running the command
      <tt>sudo halt -p</tt> (or <tt>sudo shutdown -P now</tt> is
      equivalent) inside the VM.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Don't interfere with other groups and users</h3>

    <p>Please remember that the machines the VMs are running on are a
    shared resource used by many other students at the same
    time. Don't take up so much memory, CPU, or disk space that other
    students can't use the machine. You're responsible for keeping your
    VM secure, such as by keeping passwords secret. But you're also
    responsible for not interfering with other groups' VMs. Hacking
    into another group's VM is definitely not part of the
    assignment. Because VM disk images are large, please don't store
    them on other CSE Labs machines or run QEMU on machines other than
    the one you've been assigned (to help you remember this, the CSE
    Labs staff have conveniently not installed QEMU on most other
    machines).</p>

    <p>To encourage you not to leave your VM running when you aren't
    using it, we've set it up to shut itself down if it's left running
    unattended overnight (specifically, at about 4am). If you really
    are using the machine at that time you can cancel the shutdown
    with the command <tt>sudo shutdown -c</tt>.</p>

    <h3>Advanced SSH setup</h3>

    <p>The simplest way to connect to your VM is to SSH first into
    your xHH host machine, and then from there into the VM. You can
    also copy files in two steps this way using the <tt>scp</tt>
    command: note that the option to <tt>scp</tt> for changing the
    port is a capital <tt>-P</tt>, as opposed to <tt>ssh</tt>'s
    lowercase <tt>-p</tt>. However if you're copying files a lot you
    may find that you get tired of typing all of these commands. Of
    course you can write a short script or use shell variables to
    abbreviate commands. But the best way to save yourself typing,
    because it also is more secure, is to use extra features of SSH.</p>

    <p>A better practice than SSHing first from one machine and then
    to another is to ask the first machine to just proxy your SSH
    connection to the second machine. For instance, one benefit is
    that the machine in the middle never has to see your password for
    the second machine. You can set this up by putting the following
    two commands in your <tt>.ssh/config</tt> file on your client
    machine:

<pre>
Host vm-via-xHH
  ProxyCommand ssh USERNAME@xHH.cselabs.umn.edu netcat localhost PP22
</pre>

    <br><p>Here USERNAME is your CSE Labs username, and HH and PP are host
    and port numbers as usual. Then you can use the command <tt>ssh
    student@vm-via-xHH</tt> to connect to the VM's <tt>student</tt>
    account.</p>

    <p>If you make just the change described above, it will still ask
    you to type two passwords. But you can combine this with another
    technique to avoid typing passwords, which is to create an SSH key
    pair. This approach uses public key cryptography to create a
    matched pair of a private key and a public key. You put the public
    key on the machines you want to log into, and load the private key
    into to memory of the machine you're coming from using a command
    named <tt>ssh-agent</tt>; then SSH will automatically use the
    private key to authenticate you in place of a password. There's a
    few different steps involved in setting this up, but there are a
    number of tutorials you can read on the web; one pretty good on is
    on the <a
    href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys">Ubuntu
    wiki</a>.</p>

    <p>By the way, you might notice that several users on the VM are
    already using SSH keys like this.</p>

    <h3>Testing exploits in a clean environment</h3>
    
    <p>You can set things up in your VM the way you'd like, but your
    exploits can't depend on anything special you've set up in the
    <tt>student</tt> account or on the VM, since that would make
    things harder for us to understand and grade your attack. (And of
    course since you have root access, you could install extra
    security holes on your VM, but that's not what we want to
    evaluate.) You can use the <tt>test</tt> account for a clean
    user environment within your VM.</p> 

    <p><strong>Your exploit is considered successful if it runs
    <tt>/bin/rootshell</tt> as root within a time period of 60 seconds.
    </strong></p>

    <p>Note that this means your exploit has to work using the
    software that's installed on the VM image to start. We've tried to
    include most of the things that would be useful, such as several
    different shells and scripting languages. You can install extra
    software on your VM image if you want to use it in developing your
    exploits, but your final exploit can't depend on anything special
    outside the exploit script.</p>

    <h3>Avoiding and recovering from problems</h3>

    <p><b>Your virtual machine should never be the only place where
    you have a copy of your work.</b> Part of the reason for this is
    that because of their size, we store the disk images on a
    "scratch" disk partition that is not backed up: if that disk were
    to have a hardware failure, all your VM images could be lost. So
    you should keep copies of your exploit scripts in other places,
    such as your CSE Labs home directory (which is backed up) or other
    machines of your own. However from our past experience the more
    likely thing to go wrong is in the running of your VM: in trying
    to attack it you might mess up its configuration so that it no
    longer works correctly. So here are some suggestions for avoiding
    or recovering from that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Before conducting a dangerous attack from one window, make
      sure you have another window already open in which you have a
      root shell running (e.g., <tt>sudo /bin/bash</tt>). That way if
      something goes wrong that interferes with, say, logging in, you can
      fix it using that shell. You might also want to make backup
      copies of files before you attack them; a backup copy of the
      configuration files in <tt>/etc</tt> as they were in the
      original VM image is in the directory <tt>/etc-backup</tt>.</li>

      <li>Your VM disk image is just a regular file, so you can make a
      backup of it with <tt>cp</tt>. But it's pretty big, so please
      don't keep more than 1 or 2 extra copies at once.</li>

      If you want to experiment with your VM and don't want to save any changes made, you can run 
      your VM by giving the option
      <tt>-throwaway</tt> to <tt>run-vm</tt>. When you start the VM
      with this option, all of the changes you made to the virtual
      disk will be discarded when the VM shuts down. Of course you
      definitely want to keep your exploit script elsewhere if you do
      this!</li>

      <li>If you lose the ability to log into your VM's
      <tt>student</tt> account, but the VM is otherwise working okay,
      the course staff have their own accounts that also have
      <tt>sudo</tt> access, so they should be able to reset your
      password.</li>

      <li>If you've messed up your VM in a serious way, but you have
      backups of all the important data, the easiest way to fix it may
      be to start over from a fresh VM. If you remove your
      <tt>ha1.qcow2</tt> file and run the <tt>setup-vm</tt> script
      again, it will give you a fresh disk image. Of course the
      disadvantage is you'll have to redo anything you did inside the
      VM.</li>

      <li>If you've messed up your VM badly but still have important
      information on it, you can potentially recover it in the same
      ways you would with a physical Linux machine: by booting in
      "recovery mode", using a "rescue CD" to boot, accessing the disk
      image with another VM, etc. However these are all somewhat
      complicated, so it's best to avoid this situation by using the
      techniques above. If you want to boot your VM in a non-standard
      way, you will probably want to access the VM's console over VNC,
      which you can do with a command like

	<p><tt>vncviewer -via USERNAME@xHH.cselabs.umn.edu localhost:PP</tt></p>
      The bootloader screen is only visible for 10 seconds, so you
      may want to get the VNC client almost ready to run before
      starting the VM.</p>

</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>If you want to run the VM on your own machine</h3>

    <p>The VM image and the scripts we use to run it for this assignment aren't secret, so
    in theory it would also be possible to run the VM on a non-CSE
    Labs machine using QEMU or another VMM such as VMWare or
    VirtualBox. However this is not a configuration supported by the
    course staff, so if you want to try it you're on your own. And in
    the case of any discrepancy you'll be graded according to how your
    attacks work on the CSE Labs machines, so be sure to test before
    you submit.</p>

    <h3>If you have more questions</h3>
    
    <p>Please don't hesitate to ask questions if you get stuck while
    trying to manage your VM, etc. If the question is one that
    everyone in the class can benefit from hearing the answer to, the
    best place to ask it is on the forum on the Moodle page. If you
    have a question that should be answered privately, please send it
    to both of the course staff using the email addresses on the
    syllabus to ensure a prompt response. Technical problems with the
    VMs should generally go to the course staff first rather than
    <tt>operator</tt>, since we know more about how the VMs work, but
    we'll know if we need to enlist operator.
